Amazingly as Bonington says, the area had never been visited by Europeans until his reconnaisance in August 1996. In place of maps Bonington and Clarke had to ask the way to the Great Snow Mountain by the Sacred Lake. The valley of the Diru has rich grazing, flora, farming and flourishing monasteries out of touch with the western world - a Shangri-la for real - and both our authors were accepted and welcomed into this magical way of life. This is much more than a climbing book. The poignancy of Bonington feeling his age, the camaraderie and sometimes tension between members of the team (whose ages ranged from 22 to 62) particularly within 200 metres of the summit of Sepu Kangri, are set against the magical backdrop of an unknown Tibetan world and portray an extraordinary expedition.

Within a year of turning professional in 1992 he was World Champion. In 1994 he won two stages of the Tour de France and in 1996 consolidated his position amongst cycling's elite by winning ten consecutive races. By this time, however, and unknown to him, he was battling against cancer as well as 200 fellow competitors. In early October he was diagnosed with testicular cancer so advanced he had to be operated on the very next day. And when lesions appeared on his brain and in his lungs he was given a 40% chance of survival. While he was in hospital undergoing a three month course in chemotherapy his team Codifis, who had promised to stand by him, cancelled his contract. However, by February 1997 he was out of hospital, training again and setting himself targets. He wanted to complete the 1998 Tour de France. Not only did he achieve this but he went on to win the 1999 Tour in spectacular style, in the fastest ever time, and was the first winner to take four stages in the race in 15 years. This is an extraordinary and inspirational story.","sale_price":720,"quantity":5,"category_id":6,"enabled":1,"author":"Lance Armstrong,Sally Jenkins","edition":0,"is_used_book":0,"publisher":"Random House","published_at":null,"thumbnail_url":"https:\/\/pos.booksmandala.com\/images\/4999","created_at":"2016-08-25 07:54:03","updated_at":"2022-04-03 07:46:23","deleted_at":null,"number_of_pages":294,"weight":240,"slug":"its-not-about-the-bike","is_hard_cover":0,"path":"\/books\/its-not-about-the-bike","shareable_url":"https:\/\/booksmandala.com\/books\/its-not-about-the-bike","favorite_quantity":1,"geo_price":".0.00","total_preorder":null,"media":[{"id":4999,"disk":"uploads","directory":"1\/items","filename":"9780224060875","extension":"jpg","mime_type":"image\/jpeg","aggregate_type":"image","size":2018,"created_at":"2019-08-23 09:23:48","updated_at":"2019-08-23 09:23:48","deleted_at":null,"pivot":{"mediable_id":2089,"media_id":4999,"mediable_type":"App\\Models\\Common\\Item","tag":"picture","order":1}}]},{"id":16770,"name":"The Qigong Bible","sku":"9781841814629","description":"This is the ultimate guide to practicing Qigong and finding a mental and physical balance in life, encouraging readers of all levels to make Qigong a part of their everyday routine.
