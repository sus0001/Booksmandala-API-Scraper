While his vocabulary is a bit on the he-man side (highest compliment to his wife: \"she's a stud\"), his actions will melt the most hard-bitten souls: a cancer foundation and benefit bike ride, his astonishing commitment to training that got him past countless hurdles, loyalty to the people and corporations that never gave up on him.

How to Build a Car explores the story of Adrian's unrivalled 35-year career in Formula One through the prism of the cars he has designed, the drivers he has worked alongside and the races in which he's been involved. A true engineering genius, even in adolescence Adrian's thoughts naturally emerged in shape and form - he began sketching his own car designs at the age of 12 and took a welding course in his school summer holidays. From his early career in IndyCar racing and on to his unparalleled success in Formula One, we learn in comprehensive, engaging and highly entertaining detail how a car actually works. Adrian has designed for the likes of Mario Andretti, Nigel Mansell, Alain Prost, Damon Hill, David Coulthard, Mika Hakkinen, Mark Webber and Sebastian Vettel, always with a shark-like purity of purpose: to make the car go faster. And while his career has been marked by unbelievable triumphs, there have also been deep tragedies; most notably Ayrton Senna's death during his time at Williams in 1994. Beautifully illustrated with never-before-seen drawings, How to Build a Car encapsulates, through Adrian's remarkable life story, precisely what makes Formula One so thrilling - its potential for the total synchronicity of man and machine, the perfect combination of style, efficiency and speed.","sale_price":1758,"quantity":0,"category_id":6,"enabled":1,"author":"Adrian Newey","edition":1,"is_used_book":0,"publisher":"HarperCollins","published_at":"2017-11-01","thumbnail_url":"https:\/\/pos.booksmandala.com\/images\/15232","created_at":"2020-12-02 09:07:22","updated_at":"2021-06-03 07:08:32","deleted_at":null,"number_of_pages":400,"weight":1300,"slug":"how-to-build-a-car","is_hard_cover":1,"path":"\/books\/how-to-build-a-car","shareable_url":"https:\/\/booksmandala.com\/books\/how-to-build-a-car","favorite_quantity":1,"geo_price":".0.00","total_preorder":null,"media":[{"id":15232,"disk":"uploads","directory":"1\/items","filename":"35657708._SX318_","extension":"jpg","mime_type":"image\/jpeg","aggregate_type":"image","size":23879,"created_at":"2020-12-02 09:07:22","updated_at":"2020-12-02 09:07:22","deleted_at":null,"pivot":{"mediable_id":25916,"media_id":15232,"mediable_type":"App\\Models\\Common\\Item","tag":"picture","order":1}}]},{"id":26175,"name":"Mascot","sku":"9780062911056","description":"Noah Savino has been stuck in a wheelchair for months.

Two years previously, however, Wiggins had been staring into the abyss. His much-hyped attempt to conquer the 2010 Tour de France had ended in public humiliation. Poor results and indifferent form left him facing the sack from Team Sky. And then he was hit with the tragic news of the death of his granddad, George, the man who had raised him as a young boy. At rock bottom, Wiggins had to reach deep inside himself and find the strength to fight his way back. Outspoken, honest, intelligent and fearless, Wiggins has been hailed as the people's champion. In My Time he tells the story of the remarkable journey that led him from his lowest ebb to win the world's toughest race. In his own words he reveals the personal anguish that has driven him on and what it's like behind the scenes at Team Sky: the brutal training regimes, the sacrifices and his views on his teammates and rivals. He talks too about his anger at the spectre of doping that pursues his sport, how he dealt with the rush of taking Olympic gold and above all what it takes to be the greatest.","sale_price":250,"quantity":0,"category_id":6,"enabled":1,"author":"Bradley Wiggins,William Fotheringham","edition":1,"is_used_book":1,"publisher":"Random House","published_at":"2013-01-01","thumbnail_url":"https:\/\/pos.booksmandala.com\/images\/13278","created_at":"2020-08-12 12:09:20","updated_at":"2022-03-11 11:19:56","deleted_at":null,"number_of_pages":320,"weight":295,"slug":"my-time","is_hard_cover":null,"path":"\/books\/my-time","shareable_url":"https:\/\/booksmandala.com\/books\/my-time","favorite_quantity":1,"geo_price":".0.00","total_preorder":null,"media":[{"id":13278,"disk":"uploads","directory":"1\/items","filename":"9780224092142","extension":"jpg","mime_type":"image\/jpeg","aggregate_type":"image","size":28971,"created_at":"2020-08-12 12:09:20","updated_at":"2020-08-12 12:09:20","deleted_at":null,"pivot":{"mediable_id":24698,"media_id":13278,"mediable_type":"App\\Models\\Common\\Item","tag":"picture","order":1}}]},{"id":25211,"name":"Neutral Buoyancy","sku":"U9780140287301","description":"In Neutral Buoyancy, journalist and diver Tim Ecott takes you on a guided tour of the history of undersea exploration and the emergence of diving culture. He tells the extraordinary story of man's attempts to breathe underwater, from the sponge divers described by Aristotle, to the development of sixteenth-century diving bells, to the invention of modern scuba equipment. Along the way, Ecott intersperses the story with his own thrilling adventures, from the waters of the South Pacific to the remote islands of the Seychelles, from explorations in the clear, flowing tides of Sardinia to a near-death experience in the cold gray depths of the English Channel. Filled with engaging stories of humanity's conquest of the undersea world -- and heart-pounding action that will leave you breathless -- Neutral Buoyancy is a compelling blend of history and adventure, an exciting overview of the world of undersea diving. \"As elemental, entertaining, and stimulating as the environment it traces.\" -- Kirkus Reviews \"Engaging ...

These are the individuals that have pushed the boundaries of their sport, set incredible new records or driven the human body to its physiological limits. Every day we celebrate the feats of the fastest, strongest and most brilliantly technical athletes on the planet.However, if we interrogate that history further, there are some individuals that stand head and shoulders above the others, modern day heroes who can be attributed with the status of 'icon' or 'legend' - and who are consequently bequeathed a peerless position in society. These individuals are not only differentiated by their awe-inspiring dominance of their own sport, but by the way in which we - the normal folk - reflect upon their contribution and indeed their cultural legacy.What makes Muhammad Ali, Ayrton Senna, Usain Bolt and Maradona the greatest of all time? Is it the success they achieved or the way in which they achieved it?The answer - perhaps reassuringly in an era of big data, football academies, sports science and media training - lies in the cult of personality. Zlatan is an icon not just because of his extraordinary records on the field, but because his personality has never had to take a back seat on the journey. Let's be honest, which other footballer would say - with an entirely straight face: \"One thing is for sure. A World Cup without Zlatan is nothing.\"There is only one Zlatan Ibrahimovic.","sale_price":478,"quantity":0,"category_id":6,"enabled":1,"author":"Malcolm Olivers","edition":0,"is_used_book":0,"publisher":"HarperCollins","published_at":"2017-11-02","thumbnail_url":"https:\/\/pos.booksmandala.com\/images\/4640","created_at":"2019-02-13 11:40:27","updated_at":"2019-10-16 11:02:44","deleted_at":null,"number_of_pages":144,"weight":140,"slug":"the-little-book-of-zlatan","is_hard_cover":null,"path":"\/books\/the-little-book-of-zlatan","shareable_url":"https:\/\/booksmandala.com\/books\/the-little-book-of-zlatan","favorite_quantity":1,"geo_price":".0.00","total_preorder":null,"media":[{"id":4640,"disk":"uploads","directory":"1\/items","filename":"9780008263508","extension":"jpg","mime_type":"image\/jpeg","aggregate_type":"image","size":29689,"created_at":"2019-08-20 07:51:16","updated_at":"2019-08-20 07:51:16","deleted_at":null,"pivot":{"mediable_id":19582,"media_id":4640,"mediable_type":"App\\Models\\Common\\Item","tag":"picture","order":1}}]},{"id":1166,"name":"My life","sku":"9788184001914","description":"Brett Lee is one of cricket\u2019s most prolific personalities.
