By nightfall, however, treacherous weather and human error conspired to turn triumph into catastrophe.

This gripping account, illustrated with photos, recounts vividly the author's experiences on Everest -- including the horrible night she spent huddled in the death zone with seven other climbers -- and puts the 1996 tragedy in a new perspective. Unlike Jon Krakauer, Gammelgaard was part of Fischer's team, and she sheds new light on this legendary climber's larger-than-life personality and leadership during the ascent.

With almost 250 million followers on social media and 4 million visitors to its Camp Nou stadium each year, there's little wonder its motto is 'More than a club'. But it was not always so. In the past three decades, Barcelona has transformed from regional team to global powerhouse, becoming a model of sporting excellence and a consistent winner of silverware. Simon Kuper unravels exactly how these transformations took place. He outlines the organisational structure behind the club's business decisions, and details the work of its coaches, medics, data analysts and nutritionists who have revolutionised the sporting world. And, of course, he studies the towering influence of the club's two greatest legends, Johan Cruyff and Lionel Messi. Like many leading global businesses, FC Barcelona closely guards its secrets, granting few outsiders a view behind the scenes. But, after decades of writing about the sport and the club, Kuper was given unprecedented access to the inner sanctum and to the people who strive daily to keep Barcelona at the top. Erudite, personal, and capturing all the latest successes and upheavals, his portrait of this incredible institution goes beyond football to understand Bar a as a unique social, cultural, and political phenomenon\"--Publisher's description.","sale_price":1278,"quantity":1,"category_id":6,"enabled":1,"author":"SIMON.

With a new introduction from golf performance pro Peter Hudson, the multi-million bestselling The Inner Game of Golf resolves this mental interference. It is not a book about how to play golf; it is a book about how to learn golf, and its lessons can be applied to any sport. Putting aside the mechanics of golfing technique and laborious debates about strategy, this classic handbook for golfers of all levels tackles the psychological aspects of the game and reveals how you can perform to your true potential for more than brief moments at a time. Using only his Inner Game principles, without taking a single lesson and playing only once a week, Timothy Gallwey knocked 15 strokes off his game in a year. There is no physical reason why you can't hit perfect drives or sink long putts more consistently. By applying the Inner Game approach to your own game, you too can see phenomenal improvements to your scorecard. Author BiographyEver since Timothy Gallwey missed a heartbreakingly easy volley on match point in the National Junior Tennis Championship at the age of fifteen, he has been fascinated with the problem of how human beings interfere with their own ability to achieve and learn. His search for practical ways to overcome the mental obstacles that prevent maximum performance led to the basic discoveries first described in this, his bestselling classic. - The Inner Game Of Golf By W.timothy Gallwey (Paperback)","sale_price":638,"quantity":1,"category_id":6,"enabled":1,"author":"W.

But as he approached the autumn of his career, Thierry's crown began to slip - from the infamous 'Hand of Gaul' incident to a dismal World Cup 2010 campaign. Suddenly, a player who Arsene Wenger once dubbed 'the greatest striker ever', a man who had spent his career at the very top of the game, began to learn how lonely such a position could be. Drawing from numerous interviews and impeccable sources, as well as his own observations over the course of Henry's entire career, award-winning author Philippe Auclair has produced the most complete portrait of the Arsenal hero ever to be written. Clear-eyed, lyrical and passionately argued, Thierry Henry: Lonely at the Top is as raw, shocking and thought-provoking as it is celebratory of Henry's outstanding flair and talent.

Bethpage State Park is owned by the state of New York, and no membership is required to play there. This is golf at its most populist, most pure - and most challenging. In what Tiger Woods himself would declare 'the most difficult national championship', Sergio Garcia, Phil Mickelson, Nick Faldo and the rest would, through days of rain and roughs, learn the hard way that while Bethpage may be open to the public, even for the pros the chance of winning can be closed off to mere mortals. The Bethpage course was so challenging that only one player finished under par; this was golf at its most intense. With unprecedented backstage access, John Feinstein finally removes the mystery shrouding golf's most famous event, unravelling how pairings are made; qualifiers; setting up the golf course; and all the complexities of bringing golf's most exclusive competition to a truly public setting. In fascinating detail, Feinstein takes readers through every step, every thorny hole, every bitter rivalry of one of golf's greatest tournaments.","sale_price":250,"quantity":1,"category_id":6,"enabled":1,"author":"John Feinstein","edition":1,"is_used_book":1,"publisher":"Sphere","published_at":null,"thumbnail_url":"https:\/\/pos.booksmandala.com\/images\/13770","created_at":"2020-08-21 09:54:47","updated_at":"2020-08-21 09:54:47","deleted_at":null,"number_of_pages":384,"weight":330,"slug":"open","is_hard_cover":0,"path":"\/books\/open","shareable_url":"https:\/\/booksmandala.com\/books\/open","favorite_quantity":1,"geo_price":".0.00","total_preorder":null,"media":[{"id":13770,"disk":"uploads","directory":"1\/items","filename":"9780751535969","extension":"jpg","mime_type":"image\/jpeg","aggregate_type":"image","size":30506,"created_at":"2020-08-21 09:54:47","updated_at":"2020-08-21 09:54:47","deleted_at":null,"pivot":{"mediable_id":25200,"media_id":13770,"mediable_type":"App\\Models\\Common\\Item","tag":"picture","order":1}}]},{"id":18040,"name":"No Spin: My Autobiography","sku":"9781785037719","description":"'My story, without the spin.' From the start of his glittering career in 1992, to his official retirement from all formats of the game in 2013, Shane Warne has long desired to tell his incredible story without compromise. No Spin is that very story. It will offer a compelling intimate voice, true insight and a pitch-side seat to one of cricket's finest eras, making this one of the ultimate must-have sports autobiographies. Shane is not only one of the greatest living cricket legends: he is as close as the game has had since Botham to a maverick genius on the field and a true rebel spirit off it, who always gives audiences what they want. Despite being the talismanic thorn in England's side for nearly two decades of regular Ashes defeats, he was also much loved in the UK where he played cricket for Hampshire. He's also a much-admired figure in India and South Africa. Alongside his mesmerising genius as a bowler, Shane has often been a controversial figure, and in this book he's talk with brutal honesty about some of the most challenging times in his life as a player. Honest, thoughtful, fearless and loved by millions, Shane is always his own man and this book is a testament to his brilliant career.","sale_price":1118,"quantity":1,"category_id":6,"enabled":1,"author":"Shane Warne","edition":0,"is_used_book":0,"publisher":"Ebury Press","published_at":"2018-10-04","thumbnail_url":"https:\/\/pos.booksmandala.com\/images\/4594","created_at":"2018-10-30 17:21:52","updated_at":"2021-04-22 11:03:15","deleted_at":null,"number_of_pages":384,"weight":530,"slug":"no-spin-my-autobiography","is_hard_cover":0,"path":"\/books\/no-spin-my-autobiography","shareable_url":"https:\/\/booksmandala.com\/books\/no-spin-my-autobiography","favorite_quantity":1,"geo_price":".0.00","total_preorder":null,"media":[{"id":4594,"disk":"uploads","directory":"1\/items","filename":"9781785037719","extension":"jpg","mime_type":"image\/jpeg","aggregate_type":"image","size":9022,"created_at":"2019-08-19 13:35:21","updated_at":"2019-08-19 13:35:21","deleted_at":null,"pivot":{"mediable_id":18040,"media_id":4594,"mediable_type":"App\\Models\\Common\\Item","tag":"picture","order":1}}]}],"links":{"first":"https:\/\/booksmandala.com\/api\/books?page=1","last":"https:\/\/booksmandala.com\/api\/books?page=13","prev":"https:\/\/booksmandala.com\/api\/books?page=7","next":"https:\/\/booksmandala.com\/api\/books?page=9"},"meta":{"current_page":8,"from":113,"last_page":13,"path":"https:\/\/booksmandala.com\/api\/books","per_page":16,"to":128,"total":200}}
