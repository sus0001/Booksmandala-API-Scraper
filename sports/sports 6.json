Winning a junior ice hockey championship might not mean a lot to the average person, but it means everything to the residents of Beartown, a community slowly being eaten alive by unemployment and the surrounding wilderness. A victory like this would draw national attention to the ailing town: it could attract government funding and an influx of talented athletes who would choose Beartown over the big nearby cities. A victory like this would certainly mean everything to Amat, a short, scrawny teenager who is treated like an outcast everywhere but on the ice; to Kevin, a star player just on the cusp of securing his golden future in the NHL; and to Peter, their dedicated general manager whose own professional hockey career ended in tragedy. At first, it seems like the team might have a shot at fulfilling the dreams of their entire town. But one night at a drunken celebration following a key win, something happens between Kevin and the general manager's daughter--and the next day everything seems to have changed. Accusations are made and, like ripples on a pond, they travel through all of Beartown, leaving no resident unaffected. With so much riding on the success of the team, the line between loyalty and betrayal becomes difficult to discern. At last, it falls to one young man to find the courage to speak the truth that it seems no one else wants to hear. Fredrik Backman knows that we are forever shaped by the places we call home, and in this emotionally powerful, sweetly insightful story, he explores what can happen when we carry the heavy weight of other people's dreams on our shoulders\"--","sale_price":798,"quantity":3,"category_id":6,"enabled":1,"author":"Fredrik Backman","edition":0,"is_used_book":0,"publisher":"Michael Joseph","published_at":"2018-01-31","thumbnail_url":"https:\/\/pos.booksmandala.com\/images\/1161","created_at":"2019-03-23 15:25:08","updated_at":"2022-06-13 06:04:59","deleted_at":null,"number_of_pages":496,"weight":365,"slug":"bear-town","is_hard_cover":0,"path":"\/books\/bear-town","shareable_url":"https:\/\/booksmandala.com\/books\/bear-town","favorite_quantity":1,"geo_price":".0.00","total_preorder":null,"media":[{"id":1161,"disk":"uploads","directory":"1\/items","filename":"9781405930208","extension":"jpg","mime_type":"image\/jpeg","aggregate_type":"image","size":27992,"created_at":"2019-07-28 07:33:49","updated_at":"2019-07-28 07:33:49","deleted_at":null,"pivot":{"mediable_id":19876,"media_id":1161,"mediable_type":"App\\Models\\Common\\Item","tag":"picture","order":1}}]},{"id":18350,"name":"Neymar - 2019 Updated Edition","sku":"9781785784286","description":"Having long been hailed as a future star of world soccer, Neymar has thrived under the pressure of expectation.

For eighteen years Ed Viesturs pursued climbing's holy grail: to stand atop the world's fourteen 8,000-meter peaks, without the aid of bottled oxygen. But No Shortcuts to the Top is as much about the man who would become the first American to achieve that goal as it is about his stunning quest. As Viesturs recounts the stories of his most harrowing climbs, he reveals a man torn between the flat, safe world he and his loved ones share and the majestic and deadly places where only he can go.  A preternaturally cautious climber who once turned back 300 feet from the top of Everest but who would not shrink from a peak (Annapurna) known to claim the life of one climber for every two who reached its summit, Viesturs lives by an unyielding motto, \"Reaching the summit is optional. Getting down is mandatory.\" It is with this philosophy that he vividly describes fatal errors in judgment made by his fellow climbers as well as a few of his own close calls and gallant rescues. And, for the first time, he details his own pivotal and heroic role in the 1996 Everest disaster made famous in Jon Krakauer's Into Thin Air.  In addition to the raw excitement of Viesturs's odyssey, No Shortcuts to the Top is leavened with many funny moments revealing the camaraderie between climbers. It is more than the first full account of one of the staggering accomplishments of our time; it is a portrait of a brave and devoted family man and his beliefs that shaped this most perilous and magnificent pursuit.","sale_price":1536,"quantity":2,"category_id":6,"enabled":1,"author":"Ed Viesturs,David Roberts","edition":0,"is_used_book":0,"publisher":"Broadway","published_at":"2006-01-01","thumbnail_url":"https:\/\/pos.booksmandala.com\/images\/4668","created_at":"2016-08-22 11:46:33","updated_at":"2022-05-03 14:08:50","deleted_at":null,"number_of_pages":372,"weight":310,"slug":"no-shortcuts-to-the-top-climbing-the-worlds-14-highest-peaks","is_hard_cover":0,"path":"\/books\/no-shortcuts-to-the-top-climbing-the-worlds-14-highest-peaks","shareable_url":"https:\/\/booksmandala.com\/books\/no-shortcuts-to-the-top-climbing-the-worlds-14-highest-peaks","favorite_quantity":1,"geo_price":".0.00","total_preorder":null,"media":[{"id":4668,"disk":"uploads","directory":"1\/items","filename":"9780767924719","extension":"jpg","mime_type":"image\/jpeg","aggregate_type":"image","size":44800,"created_at":"2019-08-20 10:57:45","updated_at":"2019-08-20 10:57:45","deleted_at":null,"pivot":{"mediable_id":1289,"media_id":4668,"mediable_type":"App\\Models\\Common\\Item","tag":"picture","order":1}}]},{"id":5138,"name":"Dark Shadows Falling","sku":"9780099756118","description":"In 1992, an Indian climber was left to die on the South Col of Mount Everest by other climbers who watched his feebly waving hand from their tent.

The answer appals Joe Simpson, who was himself left for dead in a cervasse in Peru in 1985 - 'because it might compromise their summit bid'. It is an ethical question that Joe is forced to confront as he climbs a hazardous route on Pumori. Now that Everest has become the playground of the rich, where commercial operators offer guided tours to the top, camping admist the detritus and unburied corpses of previous less fortunate climbers, Joe wonders if the noble instincts that once characterised mountaineering have been irrevocably displaced - as in politics, in business, in the media and in other facets of society.","sale_price":638,"quantity":2,"category_id":6,"enabled":1,"author":"Joe Simpson","edition":0,"is_used_book":0,"publisher":"Random House","published_at":null,"thumbnail_url":"https:\/\/covers.openlibrary.org\/b\/isbn\/9780099756118-L.jpg","created_at":"2016-08-31 13:30:47","updated_at":"2020-10-10 06:09:26","deleted_at":null,"number_of_pages":207,"weight":180,"slug":"dark-shadows-falling","is_hard_cover":0,"path":"\/books\/dark-shadows-falling","shareable_url":"https:\/\/booksmandala.com\/books\/dark-shadows-falling","favorite_quantity":1,"geo_price":".0.00","total_preorder":null,"media":[]},{"id":11814,"name":"The Death Zone","sku":"9780091802394","description":"The autobiographical account of the author's climb up Mount Everest.

And so began a 13-year battle to reveal the truth that finally ended in October 2012 when the cyclist was stripped of his seven Tour victories and banned from the sport for life. Walsh's gripping and moving personal account of his struggles is a revealing insight into the murkier end of professional cycling - a place where having the right doctor can make all the difference and where there existed a conspiracy of silence. As he shows, it never was about the bike. However, spurred on by a few brave people who were prepared to speak out in the hope of saving the sport they loved, Walsh continued to probe, and eventually he was vindicated when Armstrong's reputation was ruined. In this updated edition, covering Armstrong's confession to Oprah, Seven Deadly Sinstakes the reader into a world of doping and lies, but shows that there is always hope for a better future.

Two Sherpas spent hours trying to revive him, but as darkness fell, word came via radio from the expedition's leader that they should descend in order to save themselves. The news of Hall's death traveled rapidly from mountaineering websites to news media around the world, and ultimately to his family back in Australia. Early the next morning, however, an American guide, climbing with two clients and a Sherpa, was startled to find Hall sitting cross-legged on a sharp crest of the summit ridge. In this page-turning account of survival against all odds, Hall chronicles in fascinating detail the days and nights that led up to his fateful night in Mount Everest's \"death zone.\" His story is all the more miraculous given his climbing history. Hall had been part of Australia's first attempt to reach the top of Everest in 1984 but had not done any major climbing for many years, having set aside his passion in order to support his family. While others in the team achieved their dream during this 1984 expedition, Hall was forced to turn back due to illness. Thus, his triumph in reaching the summit at the age of fifty is a story unto itself. So, too, is Hall's description of his family's experience back in Australia, as sudden grief turned to relief and joy in a matter of hours. Rarely has there been such a thrilling narrative of one man's encounter with the world's tallest mountain.","sale_price":624,"quantity":2,"category_id":6,"enabled":1,"author":"Lincoln Hall","edition":0,"is_used_book":0,"publisher":null,"published_at":null,"thumbnail_url":"https:\/\/pos.booksmandala.com\/images\/2720","created_at":"2016-09-06 12:57:34","updated_at":"2020-08-31 05:27:18","deleted_at":null,"number_of_pages":313,"weight":390,"slug":"dead-lucky","is_hard_cover":0,"path":"\/books\/dead-lucky","shareable_url":"https:\/\/booksmandala.com\/books\/dead-lucky","favorite_quantity":1,"geo_price":".0.00","total_preorder":null,"media":[{"id":2720,"disk":"uploads","directory":"1\/items","filename":"9781585427192","extension":"jpeg","mime_type":"image\/jpeg","aggregate_type":"image","size":10397,"created_at":"2019-08-05 10:09:14","updated_at":"2019-08-05 10:09:14","deleted_at":null,"pivot":{"mediable_id":6260,"media_id":2720,"mediable_type":"App\\Models\\Common\\Item","tag":"picture","order":1}}]},{"id":11652,"name":"Playing to win","sku":"9780143332497","description":"'. . . being a player from India defines who I am.
