His first book, It's Not About the Bike, charted his journey back to life and went on to become an international bestseller. Now, in his much-anticipated follow-up, Armstrong shares more details of his extraordinary life story, including the births of his twin daughters Grace and Isabel. Never shy of controversy, Armstrong offers, with typical frankness, his thoughts on training, competing, winning and failure. He also tells of the work he did for the foundation he created following his dramatic recovery, addresses the daunting challenge of living in the aftermath of cancer and treatment, and shares further inspirational tales of survival. A fresh outlook on the spirit of survivors everywhere, Every Second Counts is an account of a man who strives every day to meet life's challenges - whether on his bike or off.  Every Second Counts was first published in October 2003. In an interview with Oprah Winfrey in January 2013, Lance Armstrong admitted to having taken performance enhancing drugs in all seven of the Tours de France in which he competed between 1999 and 2005.

A Day to Die For reveals the full, startling facts that led to the tragedy. Graham Ratcliffe, the first British climber to reach the summit of Mount Everest twice, was a first-hand witness, having spent the night on Everest's South Col at 26,000 ft, sheltering from the deadly storm. For years, he has shouldered a burden of guilt, feeling that he and his teammates could have saved lives that fateful night. His quest for answers has led to discoveries so important to an understanding of the disaster that he now questions why these facts were not made public sooner.

In this lively and generously illustrated book, historians Maurice Isserman and Stewart Weaver present the first comprehensive history of Himalayan mountaineering in fifty years. They offer detailed, original accounts of the most significant climbs since the 1890s, and they compellingly evoke the social and cultural worlds that gave rise to those expeditions. The book recounts the adventures of such figures as Martin Conway, who led the first authentic Himalayan climbing expedition in 1892; Fanny Bullock Workman, the pioneer explorer of the Karakoram range; George Mallory, the romantic martyr of Mount Everest fame; Charlie Houston, who led American expeditions to K2 in the 1930s and 1950s; Ang Tharkay, the legendary Sherpa, and many others. Throughout, the authors discuss the effects of political and social change on the world of mountaineering, and they offer a penetrating analysis of a culture that once emphasized teamwork and fellowship among climbers, but now has been eclipsed by a scramble for individual fame and glory.","sale_price":1110,"quantity":8,"category_id":6,"enabled":1,"author":"Maurice Isserman,Stewart Weaver","edition":0,"is_used_book":0,"publisher":"Yale University Press","published_at":null,"thumbnail_url":"https:\/\/pos.booksmandala.com\/images\/1942","created_at":"2016-08-22 11:41:53","updated_at":"2020-08-31 06:24:45","deleted_at":null,"number_of_pages":579,"weight":1060,"slug":"fallen-giants","is_hard_cover":0,"path":"\/books\/fallen-giants","shareable_url":"https:\/\/booksmandala.com\/books\/fallen-giants","favorite_quantity":1,"geo_price":".0.00","total_preorder":null,"media":[{"id":1942,"disk":"uploads","directory":"1\/items","filename":"9780300164206","extension":"jpg","mime_type":"image\/jpeg","aggregate_type":"image","size":36162,"created_at":"2019-08-01 11:12:50","updated_at":"2019-08-01 11:12:50","deleted_at":null,"pivot":{"mediable_id":1283,"media_id":1942,"mediable_type":"App\\Models\\Common\\Item","tag":"picture","order":1}}]},{"id":1290,"name":"south col: one man's adventure on the ascent of everest 1953","sku":"9781841582696","description":"Wilfrid Noyce was the first member of the 1953 Everest expedition to accomplish the ascent of the South Col, the small plateau just below the summit.

And what about individual potential: what defines a person\u2019s limits?\r\n\r\nFor years, physiology determined the answer: heart size, lung capacity, and muscle strength. But over the past decade, a wave of dramatic findings in the cutting-edge science of endurance has completely overturned our understanding of human limitation. Endure widely disseminates these findings for the first time: It\u2019s the brain that dictates how far we can go\u2014which means we can always push ourselves further.\r\n\r\nHutchinson presents an overview of science\u2019s search for understanding human fatigue, from crude experiments with electricity and frogs\u2019 legs to sophisticated brain imaging technology. Going beyond the traditional mechanical view of human limits (like a car with a brick on its gas pedal, we go until the tank runs out of gas), he instead argues that a key element in endurance is how the brain responds to distress signals\u2014whether heat, or cold, or muscles screaming with lactic acid\u2014and reveals that we can train to improve brain response.\r\n\r\nAn elite distance runner himself, Hutchinson takes us to the forefront of the new sports psychology\u2014brain electrode jolts, computer-based training, subliminal messaging\u2014and presents startling new discoveries enhancing the performance of athletes today and shows how anyone can utilize these tactics to bolster their own performance\u2014and get the most out of their bodies.","sale_price":958,"quantity":8,"category_id":6,"enabled":1,"author":"Alex Hutchinson","edition":0,"is_used_book":0,"publisher":"Harper Collins","published_at":null,"thumbnail_url":"https:\/\/pos.booksmandala.com\/images\/3973","created_at":"2019-02-13 12:44:48","updated_at":"2022-05-08 12:41:13","deleted_at":null,"number_of_pages":306,"weight":345,"slug":"endure-mind-body-and-the-curiously-elastic-limits-of-human-performance","is_hard_cover":0,"path":"\/books\/endure-mind-body-and-the-curiously-elastic-limits-of-human-performance","shareable_url":"https:\/\/booksmandala.com\/books\/endure-mind-body-and-the-curiously-elastic-limits-of-human-performance","favorite_quantity":1,"geo_price":".0.00","total_preorder":null,"media":[{"id":3973,"disk":"uploads","directory":"1\/items","filename":"9780008277062","extension":"jpg","mime_type":"image\/jpeg","aggregate_type":"image","size":11340,"created_at":"2019-08-15 05:01:42","updated_at":"2019-08-15 05:01:42","deleted_at":null,"pivot":{"mediable_id":19598,"media_id":3973,"mediable_type":"App\\Models\\Common\\Item","tag":"picture","order":1}}]}],"links":{"first":"https:\/\/booksmandala.com\/api\/books?page=1","last":"https:\/\/booksmandala.com\/api\/books?page=13","prev":"https:\/\/booksmandala.com\/api\/books?page=1","next":"https:\/\/booksmandala.com\/api\/books?page=3"},"meta":{"current_page":2,"from":17,"last_page":13,"path":"https:\/\/booksmandala.com\/api\/books","per_page":16,"to":32,"total":200}}
