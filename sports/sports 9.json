He was a member of the original Busby Babes and has devoted his career to the club, playing in 754 games over 17 years. During that period he won everything the game had to offer, played alongside some of the greats such as Best and Law, suffered devastating defeats and was involved in one of the greatest football tragedies of all time. Here, for the very first time, he tells the story of those United years. With his beloved Reds he tasted FA Cup victory in the emotional final of 1963, won three first division championships and in 1968 he reached the pinnacle of club success, winning the European Cup. Inevitably, such highs are balanced with no less dramatic lows, such as the 1957 European Cup semi-final, the highly charged 1958 FA Cup loss which followed only weeks after the horrors of the Munich Air disaster, and the 1969 European Cup defeat by Milan. He is one of the true gentlemen of football and the legacy that Bobby Charlton gives to United is beyond compare.","sale_price":250,"quantity":1,"category_id":6,"enabled":1,"author":"Bobby Charlton","edition":1,"is_used_book":1,"publisher":"Headline Book Pub Limited","published_at":"2008-01-01","thumbnail_url":"https:\/\/pos.booksmandala.com\/images\/18732","created_at":"2021-09-10 12:11:08","updated_at":"2022-05-03 08:29:00","deleted_at":null,"number_of_pages":437,"weight":360,"slug":"my-manchester-united-years","is_hard_cover":0,"path":"\/books\/my-manchester-united-years","shareable_url":"https:\/\/booksmandala.com\/books\/my-manchester-united-years","favorite_quantity":1,"geo_price":".0.00","total_preorder":null,"media":[{"id":18732,"disk":"uploads","directory":"1\/items","filename":"3339733._SX318_SY475_","extension":"jpg","mime_type":"image\/jpeg","aggregate_type":"image","size":44935,"created_at":"2021-09-10 12:11:08","updated_at":"2021-09-10 12:11:08","deleted_at":null,"pivot":{"mediable_id":28312,"media_id":18732,"mediable_type":"App\\Models\\Common\\Item","tag":"picture","order":1}}]},{"id":16550,"name":"Your 15th Club","sku":"9781847392862","description":"All golfers have fourteen clubs in their bag, but the real winners have a little something extra\u2014that mental attitude that puts their game above the others.

In a country in which a third of the population is clinically obese, competitive eating has made the leap from trestle tables and paper napkins to stadium arenas - in the past two years, more than 1.4 million households have tuned in to Nathan's hot dog contest on ESPN.  Beginning with a trip to Japan in search of the elusive (and surprising slim-line) champion Takeru Kobayashi and ending up at the sport's annual grand finale in Coney Island, Jason Fagone spends a year with the stars of the scene, watching as they eat their way into (or out of) oblivion, and finding out just what compels a 'gurgitator' to force down forty-six dozen oysters in ten minutes. Wickedly funny and devastatingly insightful, Jason Fagone uses this weirdest of sports as a lens through which to examine the dark side of the American Dream - the never-ending quest for wealth, celebrity, possessions and food.

In the years following the publication of Into Thin Air, much has changed on Mount Everest. Among all the books documenting the glorious adventures in mountains around the world, none details how the recent infusion of wealthy climbers is drawing crime to the highest place on the planet. The change is caused both by a tremendous boom in traffic, and a new class of parasitic and predatory adventurer. It's likely that Jon Krakauer would not recognize the camps that he visited on Mount Everest almost a decade ago. This book takes readers on a harrowing tour of the criminal underworld on the slopes of the world's most majestic mountain. High Crimes describes two major expeditions: the tragic story of Nils Antezana, a climber who died on Everest after he was abandoned by his guide; as well as the author's own story of his participation in the Connecticut Everest Expedition, guided by George Dijmarescu and his wife and climbing partner, Lhakpa Sherpa. Dijmarescu, who at first seemed well-intentioned and charming, turned increasingly hostile to his own wife, as well as to the author and the other women on the team. By the end of the expedition, the three women could not travel unaccompanied in base camp due to the threat of violence. Those that tried to stand against the violence and theft found that the worst of the intimidation had followed them home to Connecticut. Beatings, thefts, drugs, prostitution, coercion, threats, and abandonment on the highest slopes of Everest and other mountains have become the rule rather than the exception. Kodas describes many such experiences, and explores the larger issues these stories raise with thriller-like intensity.","sale_price":512,"quantity":1,"category_id":6,"enabled":1,"author":"Michael Kodas","edition":0,"is_used_book":0,"publisher":"Hyperion","published_at":null,"thumbnail_url":"https:\/\/covers.openlibrary.org\/b\/isbn\/9781401309848-L.jpg","created_at":"2016-08-22 08:48:27","updated_at":"2022-05-03 14:08:51","deleted_at":null,"number_of_pages":357,"weight":340,"slug":"high-crimes","is_hard_cover":0,"path":"\/books\/high-crimes","shareable_url":"https:\/\/booksmandala.com\/books\/high-crimes","favorite_quantity":1,"geo_price":".0.00","total_preorder":null,"media":[]},{"id":9136,"name":"50 years of Golfing Wisdom","sku":"9780060884765","description":"John Jacobs is one of golf's all-time great teachers, a true legend of the game who has passed on his words of wisdom to thousands of amateurs as well as to some of the world's greatest players over the last 50 years.

By the age of thirteen, he is banished to a Florida tennis camp that feels like a prison camp. Lonely, scared, a ninth-grade dropout, he rebels in ways that will soon make him a 1980s icon. He dyes his hair, pierces his ears, dresses like a punk rocker. By the time he turns pro at sixteen, his new look promises to change tennis forever, as does his lightning-fast return. \r\n\r\nAnd yet, despite his raw talent, he struggles early on. We feel his confusion as he loses to the world\u2019s best, his greater confusion as he starts to win. After stumbling in three Grand Slam finals, Agassi shocks the world, and himself, by capturing the 1992 Wimbledon. Overnight he becomes a fan favorite and a media target.\r\n\r\nAgassi brings a near-photographic memory to every pivotal match and every relationship. Never before has the inner game of tennis and the outer game of fame been so precisely limned. Alongside vivid portraits of rivals from several generations\u2014Jimmy Connors, Pete Sampras, Roger Federer\u2014Agassi gives unstinting accounts of his brief time with Barbra Streisand and his doomed marriage to Brooke Shields. He reveals a shattering loss of confidence. And he recounts his spectacular resurrection, a comeback climaxing with his epic run at the 1999 French Open and his march to become the oldest man ever ranked number one.\r\n\r\nIn clear, taut prose, Agassi evokes his loyal brother, his wise coach, his gentle trainer, all the people who help him regain his balance and find love at last with Stefanie Graf. Inspired by her quiet strength, he fights through crippling pain from a deteriorating spine to remain a dangerous opponent in the twenty-first and final year of his career. Entering his last tournament in 2006, he\u2019s hailed for completing a stunning metamorphosis, from nonconformist to elder statesman, from dropout to education advocate. And still he\u2019s not done. At a U.S. Open for the ages, he makes a courageous last stand, then delivers one of the most stirring farewells ever heard in a sporting arena.\r\n\r\nWith its breakneck tempo and raw candor, Open will be read and cherished for years. A treat for ardent fans, it will also captivate readers who know nothing about tennis. Like Agassi\u2019s game, it sets a new standard for grace, style, speed, and power.","sale_price":720,"quantity":1,"category_id":6,"enabled":1,"author":"Andre Agassi","edition":0,"is_used_book":0,"publisher":null,"published_at":null,"thumbnail_url":"https:\/\/pos.booksmandala.com\/images\/4497","created_at":"2016-11-18 09:43:46","updated_at":"2022-03-18 07:34:54","deleted_at":null,"number_of_pages":388,"weight":310,"slug":"open-an-autobiography","is_hard_cover":0,"path":"\/books\/open-an-autobiography","shareable_url":"https:\/\/booksmandala.com\/books\/open-an-autobiography","favorite_quantity":1,"geo_price":".0.00","total_preorder":null,"media":[{"id":4497,"disk":"uploads","directory":"1\/items","filename":"9780007416790","extension":"jpg","mime_type":"image\/jpeg","aggregate_type":"image","size":7674,"created_at":"2019-08-18 11:38:07","updated_at":"2019-08-18 11:38:07","deleted_at":null,"pivot":{"mediable_id":10164,"media_id":4497,"mediable_type":"App\\Models\\Common\\Item","tag":"picture","order":1}}]},{"id":16309,"name":"The Insider","sku":"9789351365662","description":"Please Read Notes: Brand New, International Softcover Edition, Printed in black and white pages, minor self wear on the cover or pages, Sale restriction may be printed on the book, but Book name, contents, and author are exactly same as Hardcover Edition.","sale_price":632,"quantity":1,"category_id":6,"enabled":1,"author":"Aakash Chopra","edition":0,"is_used_book":0,"publisher":null,"published_at":null,"thumbnail_url":"https:\/\/pos.booksmandala.com\/images\/4555","created_at":"2018-04-19 13:52:15","updated_at":"2020-08-30 10:30:50","deleted_at":null,"number_of_pages":240,"weight":265,"slug":"the-insider-2","is_hard_cover":0,"path":"\/books\/the-insider-2","shareable_url":"https:\/\/booksmandala.com\/books\/the-insider-2","favorite_quantity":1,"geo_price":".0.00","total_preorder":null,"media":[{"id":4555,"disk":"uploads","directory":"1\/items","filename":"9789351365662","extension":"jpg","mime_type":"image\/jpeg","aggregate_type":"image","size":32483,"created_at":"2019-08-19 10:36:17","updated_at":"2019-08-19 10:36:17","deleted_at":null,"pivot":{"mediable_id":16309,"media_id":4555,"mediable_type":"App\\Models\\Common\\Item","tag":"picture","order":1}}]},{"id":27319,"name":"Dickie Bird","sku":"u9780340684580","description":"Dickie Bird's retirement was an international event shown on TV screens and newspapers throughout the world.

For Neely Crenshaw, still struggling to come to terms with his explosive relationship with the Coach, his dreams of a great career in the NFL, and the choices he made as a young man, the stakes could not be higher.","sale_price":250,"quantity":1,"category_id":6,"enabled":1,"author":"John Grisham","edition":1,"is_used_book":1,"publisher":"Random House","published_at":"2004-01-01","thumbnail_url":"https:\/\/pos.booksmandala.com\/images\/11459","created_at":"2020-07-06 10:08:17","updated_at":"2021-06-17 09:52:26","deleted_at":null,"number_of_pages":181,"weight":135,"slug":"bleachers-2","is_hard_cover":null,"path":"\/books\/bleachers-2","shareable_url":"https:\/\/booksmandala.com\/books\/bleachers-2","favorite_quantity":1,"geo_price":".0.00","total_preorder":null,"media":[{"id":11459,"disk":"uploads","directory":"1\/items","filename":"9780099468196 (1)","extension":"jpg","mime_type":"image\/jpeg","aggregate_type":"image","size":17618,"created_at":"2020-07-06 10:08:17","updated_at":"2020-07-06 10:08:17","deleted_at":null,"pivot":{"mediable_id":22969,"media_id":11459,"mediable_type":"App\\Models\\Common\\Item","tag":"picture","order":1}}]},{"id":9916,"name":"Where the mountain casts its shadow","sku":"9780312339012","description":"Without risk, say mountaineers, there would be none of the self-knowledge that comes from pushing life to its extremes. For them, perhaps, it is worth the cost. But when tragedy strikes, what happens to the people left behind? Why would anyone choose to invest in a future with a high-altitude risk-taker? What is life like in the shadow of the mountain? Such questions have long been taboo in the world of mountaineering. Now, the spouses, parents and children of internationally renowned climbers finally break their silence, speaking out about the dark side of adventure. Maria Coffey confronted one of the harshest realities of mountaineering when her partner Joe Tasker disappeared on the Northeast Ridge of Everest in 1982. In Where the Mountain Casts Its Shadow, Coffey offers an intimate portrait of adventure and the conflicting beauty, passion, and devastation of this alluring obsession. Through interviews with the world's top climbers, or their widows and families-Jim Wickwire, Conrad Anker, Lynn Hill, Joe Simpson, Chris Bonington, Ed Viesturs, Anatoli Boukreev, Alex Lowe, and many others-she explores what compels men and women to give their lives to the high mountains. She asks why, despite the countless tragedies, the world continues to laud their exploits. With an insider's understanding, Coffey reveals the consequences of loving people who pursue such risk-the exhilarating highs and inevitable lows, the stress of long separations, the constant threat of bereavement, and the lives shattered in the wake of climbing accidents. Where the Mountain Casts Its Shadow is a powerful, affecting and important book that exposes the far reaching personal costs of extreme adventure.","sale_price":480,"quantity":1,"category_id":6,"enabled":1,"author":"Maria Coffey","edition":0,"is_used_book":0,"publisher":null,"published_at":null,"thumbnail_url":"https:\/\/covers.openlibrary.org\/b\/isbn\/9780312339012-L.jpg","created_at":"2016-11-16 09:07:08","updated_at":"2020-08-31 05:53:13","deleted_at":null,"number_of_pages":234,"weight":250,"slug":"where-the-mountain-casts-its-shadow-1","is_hard_cover":0,"path":"\/books\/where-the-mountain-casts-its-shadow-1","shareable_url":"https:\/\/booksmandala.com\/books\/where-the-mountain-casts-its-shadow-1","favorite_quantity":1,"geo_price":".0.00","total_preorder":null,"media":[]},{"id":18109,"name":"Mountains of the Mind","sku":"9780375714061","description":"Combining accounts of legendary mountain ascents with vivid descriptions of his own forays into wild, high landscapes, Robert McFarlane reveals how the mystery of the world\u2019s highest places has came to grip the Western imagination\u2014and perennially draws legions of adventurers up the most perilous slopes. His story begins three centuries ago, when mountains were feared as the forbidding abodes of dragons and other mysterious beasts. In the mid-1700s the attentions of both science and poetry sparked a passion for mountains; Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Lord Byron extolled the sublime experiences to be had on high; and by 1924 the death on Mt Everest of an Englishman named George Mallory came to symbolize the heroic ideals of his day. Macfarlane also reflects on fear, risk, and the shattering beauty of ice and snow, the competition and contemplation of the climb, and the strange alternate reality of high altitude, magically enveloping us in the allure of mountains at every level.","sale_price":640,"quantity":1,"category_id":6,"enabled":1,"author":"Robert Macfarlane","edition":0,"is_used_book":0,"publisher":"Vintage Books","published_at":"2004-01-01","thumbnail_url":"https:\/\/covers.openlibrary.org\/b\/isbn\/9780375714061-L.jpg","created_at":"2018-11-01 12:34:50","updated_at":"2022-01-07 11:26:50","deleted_at":null,"number_of_pages":306,"weight":325,"slug":"mountains-of-the-mind","is_hard_cover":0,"path":"\/books\/mountains-of-the-mind","shareable_url":"https:\/\/booksmandala.com\/books\/mountains-of-the-mind","favorite_quantity":1,"geo_price":".0.00","total_preorder":null,"media":[]},{"id":1216,"name":"The Everest Years","sku":"9780297842736","description":"The first volume of Chris Bonington's memoirs, I Chose to Climb, was published in 1966 and told of his initiation into mountaineering, from schoolboy beginnings, culminating in the British ascent of the North Face of the Eiger and his decision to turn professional. The Next Horizon picks up where that volume left off and relates his subsequent adventures as a mountaineer, photographer, journalist and expedition leader. This final volume in the series explores the dangerous and fraught terrain of Tibet and a love affair with the world's highest peak. In 1985 Chris Bonington crowned an already distinguished mountaineering career by reaching the summit of Everest at the age of fifty - an achievement which won him enormous popular acclaim and affection. Here he tells of his fascination with the highest point on earth and why it meant so much to him to finally stand there himself.","sale_price":1011,"quantity":1,"category_id":6,"enabled":1,"author":"Chris Bonington","edition":0,"is_used_book":0,"publisher":"Orion","published_at":null,"thumbnail_url":"https:\/\/covers.openlibrary.org\/b\/isbn\/9780297842736-L.jpg","created_at":"2016-08-22 09:34:33","updated_at":"2020-08-31 06:19:29","deleted_at":null,"number_of_pages":230,"weight":410,"slug":"the-everest-years","is_hard_cover":0,"path":"\/books\/the-everest-years","shareable_url":"https:\/\/booksmandala.com\/books\/the-everest-years","favorite_quantity":1,"geo_price":".0.00","total_preorder":null,"media":[]}],"links":{"first":"https:\/\/booksmandala.com\/api\/books?page=1","last":"https:\/\/booksmandala.com\/api\/books?page=13","prev":"https:\/\/booksmandala.com\/api\/books?page=8","next":"https:\/\/booksmandala.com\/api\/books?page=10"},"meta":{"current_page":9,"from":129,"last_page":13,"path":"https:\/\/booksmandala.com\/api\/books","per_page":16,"to":144,"total":200}}
