While climbing on Cho Oyo he meets a band of Khampas, including a four-year-old boy, fleeing over the high Nangpa La pass from the brutality of Chinese oppression in Tibet. Joe's love of Himalayan life contrasts with the ruthless Chinese destruction of the Tibetan culture and people. A violent brush with a skinhead in his home town of Sheffield is mirrored in his chilling encounter with the Peruvian police. On Huascaran, Peru's highest mountain, he hears unnerving ghostly voices and learns of the earthquake which buried 18,000 people and wiped out the town of Yungay below him. It reminds him of his boyhood visit to the Nazi concentration camp at Belsen.

On May 10, 1996, nine climbers perished in a blizzard high on Mount Everest, the single deadliest day ever on the peak. The following day, one of those victims was given a second chance. His name was Beck Weathers.The tale of Dr. Seaborn Beck Weathers's miraculous awakening from a deep hypothermic coma was widely reported. But the hidden story of what led the pathologist to Everest in the first place, and his painful recovery after his dramatic rescue, has not been told until now.  Brilliant and gregarious, Weathers discovered in his thirties that mountain climbing helped him cope with the black dog of depression that had shadowed him since college. But the self-prescribed therapy came at a steep cost: estrangement from his wife, Peach, and their two children. By the time he embarked for Everest, his home life had all but disintegrated. Yet when he was reported dead after lying exposed on the mountain for eighteen hours in subzero weather, it was Peach who orchestrated the daring rescue that brought her husband home. Only then, facing months of surgery and the loss of his hands, did Beck Weathers also begin to face himself, his family, his past and uncertain future. Told in Beck Weathers's inimitably direct and engaging voice-- with frequent commentary from Peach, their family, their friends and others involved in this unique journey-- Left for Dead shows how one man's drive to conquer themost daunting physical challenges ultimately forced him to confront greater challenges within himself. Framed by breathtaking accounts of his near death and resurrection, and of his slow and agonizing physical and emotional recovery, Left for Dead offers a fascinating look at the seductive danger of extreme sports, as in rapid succession a seemingly unstoppable Weathers attacks McKinley, Elbrus, Aconcagua, Kilimanjaro-- before fate stops him cold, high in the Death Zone of the world's tallest peak. Full of deep insight and warm humor, Left for Dead tells the story of a man, a marriage and a family that survived the unsurvivable. Candid and uncompromising, it is a deeply compelling saga of crisis and change, and of the abiding power of love and family-- a story few readers will soon forget.","sale_price":750,"quantity":52,"category_id":6,"enabled":1,"author":"Beck Weathers","edition":0,"is_used_book":0,"publisher":"Random House Digital, Inc.","published_at":null,"thumbnail_url":"https:\/\/covers.openlibrary.org\/b\/isbn\/9780375504044-L.jpg","created_at":"2016-08-22 09:55:06","updated_at":"2020-08-31 06:48:39","deleted_at":null,"number_of_pages":292,"weight":605,"slug":"left-for-dead","is_hard_cover":1,"path":"\/books\/left-for-dead","shareable_url":"https:\/\/booksmandala.com\/books\/left-for-dead","favorite_quantity":1,"geo_price":".0.00","total_preorder":null,"media":[]},{"id":12575,"name":"Facing up","sku":"9780330392266","description":"'No one could fail to be gripped by his heartfelt excitement and emotion over what was the adventure of a lifetime.'

Climbers regard it as the ultimate achievement in mountaineering, with good reason. Four times as deadly as Everest, K2 has claimed the lives of seventy-seven climbers since 1954. In August 2008 eleven climbers died in a single thirty-six-hour period on K2\u2013the worst single-event tragedy in the mountain's history and the second-worst in the long chronicle of mountaineering in the Himalaya and Karakoram ranges. Yet summiting K2 remains a cherished goal for climbers from all over the globe. Before he faced the challenge of K2 himself, Ed Viesturs, one of the world's premier high-altitude mountaineers, thought of it as \"the holy grail of mountaineering.\"In K2: Life and Death on the World's Most Dangerous Mountain, Viesturs explores the remarkable history of the mountain and of those who have attempted to conquer it. At the same time he probes K2's most memorable sagas in an attempt to illustrate the lessons learned by confronting the fundamental questions raised by mountaineering\u2013questions of risk, ambition, loyalty to one's teammates, self-sacrifice, and the price of glory. Viesturs knows the mountain firsthand. He and renowned alpinist Scott Fischer climbed it in 1992 and were nearly killed in an avalanche that sent them sliding to almost certain death. Fortunately, Ed managed to get into a self-arrest position with his ice ax and stop both his fall and Scott' s.Focusing on seven of the mountain's most dramatic campaigns, from his own troubled ascent to the 2008 tragedy, Viesturs and Roberts crafts an edge-of-your-seat narrative that climbers and armchair travelers alike will find unforgettably compelling. With photographs from Viesturs's personal collection and from historical sources, this is the definitive account of the world's ultimate mountain, and of the lessons that can be gleaned from struggling toward its elusive summit.","sale_price":520,"quantity":15,"category_id":6,"enabled":1,"author":"Ed Viesturs","edition":0,"is_used_book":0,"publisher":"Random House LLC","published_at":null,"thumbnail_url":"https:\/\/covers.openlibrary.org\/b\/isbn\/9780767932509-L.jpg","created_at":"2016-08-22 08:50:19","updated_at":"2020-08-31 06:29:30","deleted_at":null,"number_of_pages":342,"weight":695,"slug":"k2","is_hard_cover":1,"path":"\/books\/k2","shareable_url":"https:\/\/booksmandala.com\/books\/k2","favorite_quantity":1,"geo_price":".0.00","total_preorder":null,"media":[]},{"id":30004,"name":"RAFA My Story","sku":"9780751547733","description":"This autobiography gives Nadal's millions of fans what they've been waiting for - a glimpse behind the racquet to learn what really makes Nadal - an intensely private person who until now has never talked about his personal and family life - tick.","sale_price":958,"quantity":13,"category_id":6,"enabled":1,"author":"Rafael Nadal,John Carlin","edition":1,"is_used_book":0,"publisher":null,"published_at":"2012-01-01","thumbnail_url":"https:\/\/pos.booksmandala.com\/images\/20639","created_at":"2021-11-13 09:28:57","updated_at":"2022-06-01 13:06:52","deleted_at":null,"number_of_pages":304,"weight":270,"slug":"rafa-my-story","is_hard_cover":0,"path":"\/books\/rafa-my-story","shareable_url":"https:\/\/booksmandala.com\/books\/rafa-my-story","favorite_quantity":1,"geo_price":".0.00","total_preorder":null,"media":[{"id":20639,"disk":"uploads","directory":"1\/items","filename":"14814721","extension":"jpg","mime_type":"image\/jpeg","aggregate_type":"image","size":18604,"created_at":"2021-11-13 09:28:57","updated_at":"2021-11-13 09:28:57","deleted_at":null,"pivot":{"mediable_id":30004,"media_id":20639,"mediable_type":"App\\Models\\Common\\Item","tag":"picture","order":1}}]}],"links":{"first":"https:\/\/booksmandala.com\/api\/books?page=1","last":"https:\/\/booksmandala.com\/api\/books?page=13","prev":null,"next":"https:\/\/booksmandala.com\/api\/books?page=2"},"meta":{"current_page":1,"from":1,"last_page":13,"path":"https:\/\/booksmandala.com\/api\/books","per_page":16,"to":16,"total":200}}
