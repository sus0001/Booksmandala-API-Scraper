In August 2008, when eleven climbers lost their lives on K2, the world's most dangerous peak, two Sherpas survived. They had emerged from poverty and political turmoil to become two of the most skillful mountaineers on earth. Based on unprecedented access and interviews, Buried in the Sky reveals their astonishing story for the first time. Peter Zuckerman and Amanda Padoan explore the intersecting lives of Chhiring Dorje Sherpa and Pasang Lama, following them from their villages high in the Himalaya to the slums of Kathmandu, across the glaciers of Pakistan to K2 Base Camp. When disaster strikes in the Death Zone, Chhiring finds Pasang stranded on an ice wall, without an axe, waiting to die. The rescue that follows has become the stuff of mountaineering legend.

At 27, he has already been the recipient of countless accolades including the Arjuna Award, the title of BCCI's 'international cricketer of the Year' as well as the ICC's 'ODI Player of the Year', but for Kohli it's not about the money or the fame, or the roar of the crowds or the flattering attention from women of all ages.

Real Madrid is the most successful sports team on the planet. The soccer club has more trophies than any other sports team, including 11 UEFA Champions League trophies. However, the story behind the triumph goes beyond the players and coaches. Generally unnoticed, a management team consisting mostly of outsiders took the team from near bankruptcy to the most valuable sports organization in the world.  How did Real Madrid achieve such extraordinary success? Columbia Business School adjunct professor Steven G. Mandis investigates. Given unprecedented behind-the-scenes access, Mandis is the first researcher to rigorously ana- lyze both the on-the-field and business aspects of a sports team. What he learns is completely unexpected and challenges the conventional wisdom that moneyball-fueled data analytics are the primary instruments of success. Instead, Real Madrid's winning formula both on and off the field, from player selection to financial management, is based on aligning strategy with the culture and values of its fan base.  Chasing the most talented (and most expensive) players can be a recipe for a winning record, but also financial disaster, as it was for Real Madrid in the late 1990s. Real Madrid's management believes that the club exists to serve the Real Madrid community. They discovered that its fans care more about why the team exists, how their club wins, and whom it wins with versus just winning. The why, how, and whom create a community brand and identity, and inspire extraordinary passion and loyalty, which has led to amazing marketing and commercial success--in turn, attracting and paying for the best players in the world, with the values the fans expect. The club's values and culture also provide a powerful environment for these best players to work together to win trophies.  The Real Madrid Way explains how Real Madrid has created and maintains a culture that drives both financial and on-the-field success. This book is an engrossing account of the lifetime of one of the greatest clubs in the most popular sport in the world, and for business and organization leaders, it's an invaluable inside look at a compelling alternative model with lasting competitive advantages that can deliver superior and sustainable returns and performance.","sale_price":1598,"quantity":3,"category_id":6,"enabled":1,"author":"Steven G Mandis","edition":0,"is_used_book":0,"publisher":"Benbella Books","published_at":"2016-10-11","thumbnail_url":"https:\/\/pos.booksmandala.com\/images\/4645","created_at":"2019-02-05 16:04:20","updated_at":"2020-10-17 08:47:18","deleted_at":null,"number_of_pages":304,"weight":440,"slug":"the-real-madrid-way","is_hard_cover":0,"path":"\/books\/the-real-madrid-way","shareable_url":"https:\/\/booksmandala.com\/books\/the-real-madrid-way","favorite_quantity":1,"geo_price":".0.00","total_preorder":null,"media":[{"id":4645,"disk":"uploads","directory":"1\/items","filename":"9781942952541","extension":"jpg","mime_type":"image\/jpeg","aggregate_type":"image","size":2627,"created_at":"2019-08-20 08:02:53","updated_at":"2019-08-20 08:02:53","deleted_at":null,"pivot":{"mediable_id":19490,"media_id":4645,"mediable_type":"App\\Models\\Common\\Item","tag":"picture","order":1}}]},{"id":1076,"name":"8 Minutes in the Morning Kit","sku":"9781401902797","description":"With his simple system Jorge Cruise claims you will shed two pounds a week and will not do aerobics, not spend hours in the gym and not be on a starvation diet.

Adam meets a mysterious young teaching pro named Wendy who, in seven crisp, short yet profound lessons, teaches him things that seem baffling at first: - You and the ball are one - Find the now, and you will find the shot - Let the game play you From the moment they begin to put these lessons into practice, what was previously a humiliation turns into a transforming experience, not just for Adam's score but for his whole life. Long a famous writer on spiritual subjects, hailed as the poet-philosopher of mind-body medicine, Deepak Chopra found himself fascinated by the game of golf. He could not escape its parallels to life: 'Golf is like lightning caught in a bottle. It can turn triumph into disaster in a split second.' Faced with the wild ups and downs of his own game, Chopra crystallised a teaching based on mindfulness, the ability to remain calm and focused, relaxed and powerful at the same time. Mindfulness can improve any golf game, from the beginner's to the tour professional's. And it can improve anybody's life, no matter what game they play - or none.","sale_price":638,"quantity":3,"category_id":6,"enabled":1,"author":"Deepak Chopra","edition":0,"is_used_book":0,"publisher":"Random House","published_at":"2005-01-01","thumbnail_url":"https:\/\/pos.booksmandala.com\/images\/2792","created_at":"2016-08-26 09:12:53","updated_at":"2020-08-28 09:17:49","deleted_at":null,"number_of_pages":200,"weight":165,"slug":"golf-for-enlightenment","is_hard_cover":0,"path":"\/books\/golf-for-enlightenment","shareable_url":"https:\/\/booksmandala.com\/books\/golf-for-enlightenment","favorite_quantity":1,"geo_price":".0.00","total_preorder":null,"media":[{"id":2792,"disk":"uploads","directory":"1\/items","filename":"9781844135813-us","extension":"jpg","mime_type":"image\/jpeg","aggregate_type":"image","size":24465,"created_at":"2019-08-06 05:35:05","updated_at":"2019-08-06 05:35:05","deleted_at":null,"pivot":{"mediable_id":2648,"media_id":2792,"mediable_type":"App\\Models\\Common\\Item","tag":"picture","order":1}}]}],"links":{"first":"https:\/\/booksmandala.com\/api\/books?page=1","last":"https:\/\/booksmandala.com\/api\/books?page=13","prev":"https:\/\/booksmandala.com\/api\/books?page=4","next":"https:\/\/booksmandala.com\/api\/books?page=6"},"meta":{"current_page":5,"from":65,"last_page":13,"path":"https:\/\/booksmandala.com\/api\/books","per_page":16,"to":80,"total":200}}
