It has been a dramatic period, seeing the rise of Twenty20 cricket and the IPL, as well as the revival of England's prospects, breaking a long era of Australian dominance in the Ashes. There has also been controversy, too, with terrorist attacks, Zimbabwe and allegations of Pakistani spot-fixing all distracting fans from the essence of the game. Through it all, Atherton comments with the true insight of one who has been there, the humane understanding of someone who has genuine empathy for the issues involved and, above all, his opinions are based on a deep love for the game and sport in general.

When Arsene Wenger arrived at Arsenal in 1996, he was little known to fans at the club and many doubted he could bring back the glory days of George Graham. But soon he was transforming the way the team played, melding the famous English defensive spine of Tony Adams, Martin Keown, Lee Dixon, Nigel Winterburn and David Seaman with a hugely creative foreign attacking spirit, epitomised by Dennis Bergkamp, Thierry Henry and Robert Pires, that could both outplay and outmuscle their rivals. At the same time, he introduced new ideas on diet, exercise, training and tactics, which many players believe extended their careers.  Having won numerous trophies, and led the Invincibles to an unprecedented unbeaten league season in 2003-04, Wenger then had to help the Gunners through the next stage of their development when they moved from Highbury to the Emirates Stadium, a move that was followed by a nine-year trophy drought. Despite the financial constraints he faced, he still managed to keep the club playing in the Champions League year after year while remaining true to his philosophy of how the game should be played. Some began to question whether he had been left behind, despite picking up back-to-back FA Cups in 2014 and 2015, and from some quarters calls grew for him to retire, though in May 2017 he signed another two-year deal to stay at the club.   Now, in this updated edition of John Cross's acclaimed biography, the author provides a compelling account of the man and his methods. He assesses the scale of Wenger's achievements, as he reaches 20 years in charge of Arsenal, and provides the most complete portrait of the Frenchman yet written.","sale_price":798,"quantity":0,"category_id":6,"enabled":1,"author":"John Cross,","edition":1,"is_used_book":0,"publisher":null,"published_at":"2016-08-18","thumbnail_url":"https:\/\/pos.booksmandala.com\/images\/15077","created_at":"2020-11-14 12:48:32","updated_at":"2021-10-03 05:31:23","deleted_at":null,"number_of_pages":320,"weight":335,"slug":"arsene-wenger","is_hard_cover":0,"path":"\/books\/arsene-wenger","shareable_url":"https:\/\/booksmandala.com\/books\/arsene-wenger","favorite_quantity":1,"geo_price":".0.00","total_preorder":null,"media":[{"id":15077,"disk":"uploads","directory":"1\/items","filename":"28248672._SY475_","extension":"jpg","mime_type":"image\/jpeg","aggregate_type":"image","size":30506,"created_at":"2020-11-14 12:48:32","updated_at":"2020-11-14 12:48:32","deleted_at":null,"pivot":{"mediable_id":25778,"media_id":15077,"mediable_type":"App\\Models\\Common\\Item","tag":"picture","order":1}}]},{"id":1208,"name":"View from the Summit","sku":"9780552151047","description":"The first man to set foot on the summit of Everest, the man who led a team of tractors to the South Pole, the man who jetboated up the Ganges from the ocean to the sky has, for the first time, gathered all the remarkable adventures of a long life into one volume.

His exploits on the field have brought hope and joy to millions of fans. And yet, like God, he has his set of detractors always willing to remove him from the pedestal. In this revised and updated edition, the authors, who consider themselves fans and analysts in equal measure, follow the career of the cricketing demigod - his advent, his peak, his fall, his resurrection and, finally, his retirement. They also talk about India's sensational WC 2011 triumph and Tendulkar's decision to retire from international cricket. Armed with irrefutable statistical data, which they contextualize and analyse with rigour, the authors seek to end all debate on Tendulkar's status as the greatest cricketer of the modern era. They compare him with his peers in both forms of the game, and provide the viewpoint of experts, players and commentators, so that the reader can independently draw conclusions.
