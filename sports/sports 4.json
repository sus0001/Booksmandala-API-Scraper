Shattered by his failure at the 2004 Athens Olympics when a gold medal seemed imminent, he changed as a shooter: he became an athlete bent on redemption, a scientist who would try anything to win at the Beijing Olympics in 2008. His victory was not just a personal one, it broke a sporting barrier that had haunted a nation for a century. This revised edition brings the story up to date, including what happened at the Rio Olympics in 2016, where he narrowly missed being among the medals. Bindra also reveals, for the first time, how he started to suffer from epileptic seizures while in the middle of preparing for Rio, and how he overcame this hurdle. Closely involved in telling this remarkable story is sportswriter Rohit Brijnath, who gets into Bindra's mind to help produce one of the finest autobiographies written yet of an Indian sportsman.","sale_price":560,"quantity":5,"category_id":6,"enabled":1,"author":"Abhinav BINDRA","edition":0,"is_used_book":0,"publisher":null,"published_at":null,"thumbnail_url":"https:\/\/pos.booksmandala.com\/images\/455","created_at":"2017-10-16 10:01:13","updated_at":"2020-08-30 10:52:24","deleted_at":null,"number_of_pages":269,"weight":330,"slug":"a-short-at-history","is_hard_cover":0,"path":"\/books\/a-short-at-history","shareable_url":"https:\/\/booksmandala.com\/books\/a-short-at-history","favorite_quantity":1,"geo_price":".0.00","total_preorder":null,"media":[{"id":455,"disk":"uploads","directory":"1\/items","filename":"9789352645756","extension":"jpg","mime_type":"image\/jpeg","aggregate_type":"image","size":28548,"created_at":"2019-07-16 08:53:14","updated_at":"2019-07-16 08:53:14","deleted_at":null,"pivot":{"mediable_id":14744,"media_id":455,"mediable_type":"App\\Models\\Common\\Item","tag":"picture","order":1}}]},{"id":9143,"name":"Round Kangchenjunga","sku":"b1300","description":"This is a reproduction of a book published before 1923.

Throughout his playing career, he was synonymous with Total Football, a style of play in which every player could play in any position on the pitch. Today, his philosophy lives on in teams across Europe, from Barcelona to Bayern Munich and players from Lionel Messi to Cesc Fabrecas.\r\n\r\nMy Turn tells the story of Cruyff's life starting at Ajax, where he won eight national titles and three European Cups before moving to Barcelona where he won La Liga in his first season, in 1973, and was named European Footballer of the Year. He won the Ballon d'Or three times, and led the Dutch national team to the final of the 1974 World Cup, famously losing to West Germany, and receiving the Golden Ball as the player of the tournament.\r\n\r\nOff the field his life was more turbulent, surviving a kidnapping attempt and bankruptcy. This honest and unflinching autobiography also explores his life after retirement, when he became a hugely successful manager of Ajax and then Barcelona when he won the Champions league with a young Pep Guardiola in his team. My Turn is the inspirational account of a legendary football hero, voted European Player of the Century, in his own words.\r\n\r\nIn March 2016 Cruyff died after a short battle with lung cancer bringing world football to a standstill in an outpouring of emotions.

That Simpson survived his experience on Peru's Siula Grande is a revelation of the power of the human spirit to overcome fear, pain and deprivation of almost unimaginable intensity. He did not expect to live it all over again - more than once. The first test was to write his award-winning account of the ordeal in Touching the Void. That meant dragging the terrifying experience out of the deeper shadows of his memory. Next, another fall in the Himalaya crippled and almost broke him. He felt forced to test his nerve again, and struggled on crutches to 20,000 feet on Pumori, near Everest. On his descent he heard that a young, first-time climber had been killed by a chance rockfall. What sense could he make now of this game of ghosts that had claimed the lives of so many of his friends over the years he had been climbing, while he had survived so many events that should have meant certain death? In an attempt to find catharsis for his confused emotions he wrote this e xtraordinary memoir, revealing his early ife and his fifteen years of climbing on three continents, before and after the life-changing experience of Siula Grande. His gripping story recounts, with total honesty, experiences that range from hilarious to poignant to nearly unbelievable. Here are the signposts that have directed him since childhood to measure fear and embrace the unknown. He wonders about the luck or the choices along the way that have caused the loss of so many climbing friends: \"Ghosts everywhere I look, all Isee are ghosts - or perhaps I am the ghost, a spectre of my past, standing in the rubble of my present, anxiously awaiting the future.\" This is a compelling work of adventure and introspection that will hold both moutaineers and armchair travelers spellbound.","sale_price":550,"quantity":4,"category_id":6,"enabled":1,"author":"Joe Simpson","edition":0,"is_used_book":0,"publisher":"Random House","published_at":null,"thumbnail_url":"https:\/\/covers.openlibrary.org\/b\/isbn\/9780099380115-L.jpg","created_at":"2016-08-31 14:31:40","updated_at":"2020-10-10 06:10:01","deleted_at":null,"number_of_pages":330,"weight":285,"slug":"this-game-of-ghosts","is_hard_cover":0,"path":"\/books\/this-game-of-ghosts","shareable_url":"https:\/\/booksmandala.com\/books\/this-game-of-ghosts","favorite_quantity":1,"geo_price":".0.00","total_preorder":null,"media":[]},{"id":27168,"name":"Why We Kneel How We Rise","sku":"9781398503243","description":"Through the prism of sport and conversations with its legends, including Usain Bolt, Adam Goodes, Thierry Henry, Michael Johnson, Ibtihaj Muhammad, Makhaya Ntini, Naomi Osaka and Hope Powell, Michael Holding explains how racism dehumanises people; how it works to achieve that end; how it has been ignored by history and historians; and what it is like to be treated differently just because of the colour of your skin.\r\n\r\nRarely can a rain delay in a cricket match have led to anything like the moment when Holding spoke out in the wake of the #BlackLivesMatter protests about the racism he has suffered and has seen all around him throughout his life.

During his tempestuous career he played for top clubs in South America and Europe, and was a central figure in four World Cups. With the fortunes he has earned from sponsorship and transfer deals, he personified football, both as popular sport and big business. Jimmy Burns pursued his research in several countries on both sides of the Atlantic, gaining access to Maradona's inner circle, and to other key witnesses, such as players, managers, trainers, doctors and officials. The result is a story straddling the international scene, from the slums of Buenos Aires, where Maradona was born, to the huge stadiums of the United States from where, in 1994, he was ignobly expelled after undergoing a positive drugs test. In his rise to fame - and notoriety - Maradona played for some of the world's greatest teams: Boca Juniors, Napoli and Barcelona. He scored some brilliant goals - and cheated with others. He provoked fans into a mass hysteria of adulation, and his enemies into sinister campai. Now, as coach of Argentina, he is leading the country into the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. This new edition brings the story of Maradona completely up to date.","sale_price":798,"quantity":4,"category_id":6,"enabled":1,"author":"Jimmy Burns","edition":1,"is_used_book":0,"publisher":"Bloomsbury Publishing UK","published_at":"2010-06-07","thumbnail_url":"https:\/\/pos.booksmandala.com\/images\/15887","created_at":"2021-02-07 09:32:54","updated_at":"2022-03-24 14:14:13","deleted_at":null,"number_of_pages":272,"weight":270,"slug":"maradona","is_hard_cover":0,"path":"\/books\/maradona","shareable_url":"https:\/\/booksmandala.com\/books\/maradona","favorite_quantity":1,"geo_price":".0.00","total_preorder":null,"media":[{"id":15887,"disk":"uploads","directory":"1\/items","filename":"9060928","extension":"jpg","mime_type":"image\/jpeg","aggregate_type":"image","size":28191,"created_at":"2021-02-07 09:32:54","updated_at":"2021-02-07 09:32:54","deleted_at":null,"pivot":{"mediable_id":26174,"media_id":15887,"mediable_type":"App\\Models\\Common\\Item","tag":"picture","order":1}}]},{"id":30020,"name":"THE NEXT EVEREST","sku":"9789389104554","description":"A dramatic account of the deadly earthquake on Everest--and a return to reach the summit.\r\n\r\nOn April 25, 2015, Jim Davidson was climbing Mount Everest when a 7.8 magnitude earthquake released avalanches all around him and his team, destroying their only escape route and trapping them at nearly 20,000 feet. It was the largest earthquake in Nepal in eighty-one years and killed about 8,900 people. That day also became the deadliest in the history of Everest, with eighteen people losing their lives on the mountain.\r\n\r\nAfter spending two unsettling days stranded on Everest, Davidson's team was rescued by helicopter. The experience left him shaken, and despite his thirty-three years of climbing and serving as an expedition leader, he wasn't sure that he would ever go back. But in the face of risk and uncertainty, he returned in 2017 and finally achieved his dream of reaching the summit.\r\n\r\nSuspenseful and engrossing, The Next Everest portrays the experience of living through the biggest disaster to ever hit the mountain. Davidson's background in geology and environmental science makes him uniquely qualified to explain how this natural disaster unfolded and why the seismic threats lurking beneath Nepal are even greater today. But this story is not about \"conquering\" the world's highest peak. Instead, it reveals how embracing change, challenge, and uncertainty prepares anyone to face their \"next Everest\" in life.","sale_price":1118,"quantity":4,"category_id":6,"enabled":1,"author":"Jim Davidson","edition":1,"is_used_book":0,"publisher":null,"published_at":null,"thumbnail_url":"https:\/\/pos.booksmandala.com\/images\/20655","created_at":"2021-11-13 12:03:19","updated_at":"2022-01-26 05:35:20","deleted_at":null,"number_of_pages":408,"weight":470,"slug":"the-next-everest","is_hard_cover":0,"path":"\/books\/the-next-everest","shareable_url":"https:\/\/booksmandala.com\/books\/the-next-everest","favorite_quantity":1,"geo_price":".0.00","total_preorder":null,"media":[{"id":20655,"disk":"uploads","directory":"1\/items","filename":"9789389104554","extension":"jpg","mime_type":"image\/jpeg","aggregate_type":"image","size":17315,"created_at":"2021-11-13 12:03:19","updated_at":"2021-11-13 12:03:19","deleted_at":null,"pivot":{"mediable_id":30020,"media_id":20655,"mediable_type":"App\\Models\\Common\\Item","tag":"picture","order":1}}]},{"id":31571,"name":"How Life Imitates Chess","sku":"9781529156294","description":"____ *THE STRATEGIES BEHIND A SUCCESSFUL LIFE FROM THE LEGENDARY GRANDMASTER AND ADVISOR TO NETFLIX'S THE QUEEN'S GAMBIT, NOW WITH A NEW FOREWORD*  'In this book, chess is a teacher, and I aim to show it is a great one.'

A World Cup-winner with France, he became the world's most expensive player in 2001 when he moved from Juventus to Real Madrid for \u00a346million, where his exceptional talent earned him a reputation as one of the greatest players of all-time. His playing career concluded explosively when he retired after being sent off for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the 2006 World Cup final.  But his football career was far from over. After a spell coaching in Spain, he was appointed manager of Real Madrid in 2015 and immediately demonstrated that his skill as a manager matched his talent on the pitch, leading the team to successive Champions League victories and establishing him as one of the new managerial greats. Rarely speaking to the press, Zidane is known as a man who 'speaks only with the ball'. In this definitive biography, Patrick Fort and Jean Philippe take us behind the scenes of his exceptional career, revealing the man behind the legend.","sale_price":1118,"quantity":4,"category_id":6,"enabled":1,"author":"Patrick Fort,Jean Philippe","edition":0,"is_used_book":0,"publisher":"Ebury Press","published_at":"2018-05-15","thumbnail_url":"https:\/\/pos.booksmandala.com\/images\/4609","created_at":"2018-05-16 19:38:25","updated_at":"2021-12-05 07:40:05","deleted_at":null,"number_of_pages":352,"weight":395,"slug":"zidane-the-biography","is_hard_cover":0,"path":"\/books\/zidane-the-biography","shareable_url":"https:\/\/booksmandala.com\/books\/zidane-the-biography","favorite_quantity":1,"geo_price":".0.00","total_preorder":null,"media":[{"id":4609,"disk":"uploads","directory":"1\/items","filename":"9781785038488","extension":"jpg","mime_type":"image\/jpeg","aggregate_type":"image","size":30388,"created_at":"2019-08-20 06:21:58","updated_at":"2019-08-20 06:21:58","deleted_at":null,"pivot":{"mediable_id":16490,"media_id":4609,"mediable_type":"App\\Models\\Common\\Item","tag":"picture","order":1}}]}],"links":{"first":"https:\/\/booksmandala.com\/api\/books?page=1","last":"https:\/\/booksmandala.com\/api\/books?page=13","prev":"https:\/\/booksmandala.com\/api\/books?page=3","next":"https:\/\/booksmandala.com\/api\/books?page=5"},"meta":{"current_page":4,"from":49,"last_page":13,"path":"https:\/\/booksmandala.com\/api\/books","per_page":16,"to":64,"total":200}}
