The Daily Mirror  Sir Chris Bonington memoir Ascent will chart not only his many triumphs in the climbing world - such as the Eiger, and the Himalaya - but also the struggles he has faced in his life bringing up a family, and maintaining a successful and loving marriage over the decades of travelling the world to conquer mountains.  He has undertaken nineteen Himalayan expeditions, including four to Mount Everest which he climbed in 1985 at the age of fifty, and has made many first ascents in the Alps and greater ranges of the world. Along the way we will be fascinated by his many daring climbs, near-death adventures, and the many luminaries of the mountain fraternity he has climbed with, and in some cases - witness their deaths on the rock. The mercurial Dougal Haston; the legendary-tough Don Whillans, the philosopher of the rock Stephen Venables, and the enigmatic Doug Scott, plus many more - this will be an expert's opinion on the past sixty years of British\/ world mountaineering.  In Ascent Chris also discusses his first wife (Wendy) who tragically passed away after a long battle with motor neuron disease - his many years of caring for her, and then in his twilight years deciding to return to an iconic climb from his past - The Old Man of Hoy - to summit at the age of 80 years of age. He has now also found love again amidst the sadness and grief. It is a truly inspirational tale.  Ascent will be a memoir like no other.

It was the first night of the Indian Premier League cricket, but not as we knew it. It involved big money, glitz, prancing girls and Bollywood stars. It was not so much sport as tamasha: a great entertainment.How a game and a country, both regarded as synonymous with infinite patience, managed to produce such an event. James Astill explains how India's economic surge and cricketing obsession made it the dominant power in world cricket, off the field if rarely on it. He tells how cricket has become the central focus of the world's second biggest nation: the place where power and money and celebrity and corruption all meet, to the rapt attention of a billion eyeballs.Astill crosses the subcontinent and over endless cups of tea, meets the people who make up modern India from faded princes to backstreet bookmakers, slum kids to squillionaires and sees how cricket shapes their lives and that of their country. Finally, in London he meets Indian cricket's fallen star, Lalit Modi, whose driving energy helped build this new form of cricket before he was dismissed in disgrace: a story that says much about modern India.It is a fascinating examination of the most important development in cricket today. A brilliant evocation of an endlessly beguiling country, it is also essential reading for anyone who wants to understand the workings of modern India.

These documents reveal the clandestine dealings of clubs, players and agents at the highest echelons of international football. And the story they tell is astonishing. From the eye-popping details of player transfers, including Neymar Jr, Pogba and Coutinho, to the loopholes and opaque tax structures that ensure maximum earnings for players and agents alike, this is a tale rife with rapacious greed and questionable deals. At the same time, it is the gripping story of a fan who wanted to free football from its corrupt overlords - and now finds himself on the run.","sale_price":798,"quantity":1,"category_id":6,"enabled":1,"author":"Rafael Buschmann","edition":0,"is_used_book":0,"publisher":"Guardian Faber Publishing","published_at":"2018-05-24","thumbnail_url":"https:\/\/pos.booksmandala.com\/images\/2235","created_at":"2019-02-05 13:14:13","updated_at":"2022-03-24 06:00:10","deleted_at":null,"number_of_pages":314,"weight":280,"slug":"football-leaks","is_hard_cover":0,"path":"\/books\/football-leaks","shareable_url":"https:\/\/booksmandala.com\/books\/football-leaks","favorite_quantity":1,"geo_price":".0.00","total_preorder":null,"media":[{"id":2235,"disk":"uploads","directory":"1\/items","filename":"9781783351404","extension":"jpg","mime_type":"image\/jpeg","aggregate_type":"image","size":60624,"created_at":"2019-08-03 05:51:14","updated_at":"2019-08-03 05:51:14","deleted_at":null,"pivot":{"mediable_id":19463,"media_id":2235,"mediable_type":"App\\Models\\Common\\Item","tag":"picture","order":1}}]},{"id":12559,"name":"True to Form","sku":"9780062315311","description":"Radical in its simplicity, Dr. Eric Goodman\u2019s visionary approach to mindful movement corrects the complacent adaptations that lead to back and joint pain, and teaches us to harness the body\u2019s natural movement patterns into daily activities to make us fit, healthy, and pain free.Our sedentary lifestyle has led to an epidemic of chronic pain.

Since his epic battle for survival in the Andes, recounted in Touching the Void, Joe Simpson has experienced a life filled with adventure but marred by death. He has endured the painful attrition of climbing friends in accidents which call into question the perilously exhilarating activity to which he has devoted his whole life. Probability is inexorably closing in. The tragic loss of a close friend forces a momentous decision. It is time to turn his back on the mountains that he has loved. Never more alive than when most at risk, he has come to see a last climb on the mile-high North Face of the Eiger as the cathartic finale to his climbing career. In a narrative that takes the reader through extreme experiences from an avalanche in Bolivia, ice-climbing in the Alps and Colorado and paragliding in Spain -- before his final confrontation with the Eiger -- Simpson reveals the inner truth of climbing, exploring the power of the mind and the frailties of the body through intensely lived accounts of exhilaration and despair. The subject of his new book is the siren song of fear and his struggle to come to terms with it.","sale_price":638,"quantity":1,"category_id":6,"enabled":1,"author":"Joe Simpson","edition":0,"is_used_book":0,"publisher":"Random House","published_at":"2016-08-31","thumbnail_url":"https:\/\/covers.openlibrary.org\/b\/isbn\/9780099422433-L.jpg","created_at":"2016-08-31 13:19:09","updated_at":"2020-10-10 06:09:44","deleted_at":null,"number_of_pages":304,"weight":265,"slug":"the-beckoning-silence","is_hard_cover":0,"path":"\/books\/the-beckoning-silence","shareable_url":"https:\/\/booksmandala.com\/books\/the-beckoning-silence","favorite_quantity":1,"geo_price":".0.00","total_preorder":null,"media":[]}],"links":{"first":"https:\/\/booksmandala.com\/api\/books?page=1","last":"https:\/\/booksmandala.com\/api\/books?page=13","prev":"https:\/\/booksmandala.com\/api\/books?page=6","next":"https:\/\/booksmandala.com\/api\/books?page=8"},"meta":{"current_page":7,"from":97,"last_page":13,"path":"https:\/\/booksmandala.com\/api\/books","per_page":16,"to":112,"total":200}}
